# pf2e-quick-creature-builder
Adds a new menu to the actors tab which builds approprietly-statted NPC actors for Pathfinder 2e.  Instead of consulting tables, GMs can select extreme'high/moderate/low for individual creature stats and automatically generate the appropriate values by the creature's level.
